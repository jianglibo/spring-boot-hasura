## A scoffold application for SpringBoot and Hasura

It's very productive to use SpringBoot and Hasura together. Frontend developers could even start the work before writing the backend.

Usually, itâ€™s inappropriate to communicate the browser direct with the Hasura server. So we could add a proxy at SpringBoot using the SpringCloud gateway, by adding the filters to the proxy we could archive most fine control to the data flow.
